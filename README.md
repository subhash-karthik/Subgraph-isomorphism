# Subgraph-isomorphism
Problem Statement:
Given a graph database D consisting labelled graphs g1, g2, ...., gn, the goal is to find the subset of D consisting the graphs that are contained in the given query graph. This can be also be stated as a super graph search problem because we want to find which of the database graphs have query graph as their supergraph, which means we have implementing Subgraph Isomorphism between Query
and Dataset.
